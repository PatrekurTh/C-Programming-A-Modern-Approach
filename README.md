# C-Programming-A-Modern-Approach
My solutions to the book "C Programming: A Modern Approach" 2nd edition by K.N. King.  
I attempt the exercises using only the definitions provided up to that point and strive to include explanations for my answers, especially for the exercises.  
Old programming projects will not be refactored when new, better methods are discovered. This is often the subject of projects in subsequent chapters as well.
