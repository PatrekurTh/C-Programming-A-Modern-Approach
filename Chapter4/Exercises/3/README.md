What is the value of each of the following expressions in C89? (Give all possible values if
an expression may have more than one value.)
(a) 8 / 5
(b) -8 / 5
(c) 8 / -5
(d) -8 / -5
```

**Solutions**  
*The C89 standard states that if either operand is negative,  
the result of a division can be rounded either up or down.  
(For example, the value of -9 / 7 could be either –1 or –2).*  
(a) 1  
(b) -1 or -2  
(c) -1 or -2  
(d) 1 or 2
