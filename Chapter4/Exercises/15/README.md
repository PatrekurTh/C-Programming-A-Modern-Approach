```
Give the values of i and j after each of the following expression statements has been exe-
cuted. (Assume that i has the value 1 initially and j has the value 2.)
(a) i += j;
(b) i--;
(c) i * j / i;
(d) i % ++j;
```

**Solutions**  
*I assume it is implied these are run in sequence*
(a) i = 3, j = 2  
(b) i = 2, j = 2  
(c) i = 2, j = 2  
(d) i = 2, j = 3
