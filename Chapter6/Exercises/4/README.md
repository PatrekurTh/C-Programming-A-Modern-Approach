```
Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that the
loop bodies are the same)?
(a) for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) …
(b) for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) …
(c) for (i = 0; i++ < 10; ) …
```

**Solution**  
a and b (i is incremented after the check before the iteration in c)
