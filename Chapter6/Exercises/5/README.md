```
Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that the
loop bodies are the same)?
(a) while (i < 10) {…}
(b) for (; i < 10;) {…}
(c) do {…} while (i < 10);
```

**Solution**  
(c) will run its loop body atleast once, so if i starts less than 10 (a) and (b) will not run.
