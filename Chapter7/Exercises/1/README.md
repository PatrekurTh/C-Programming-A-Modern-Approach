Give the decimal value of each of the following integer constants.
(a) 077
(b) 0x77
(c) 0XABC
```

**Solutions**  
(a) 63
- Explanation:  
    Starting with 0 -> octal (base 8)  
    = 7 * 8^0^ + 7 * 8^1^  
    = 7 + 56  
    = 63  

(b) 119  
- Explanation:  
    Starting with 0x -> hex (base 16)  
    = 7 * 16^0^ + 7 * 16^1^
    = 7 + 112  
    = 119  

(c) 2748
- Explanation:  
    A = 10, B = 11, C = 12  
    = 12 * 16^0^ + 11 * 16^1^ + 10 * 16^2^  
    = 12 + 176 + 2560  
    = 2748
