```
Suppose that i and j are variables of type int. What is the type of the expression i / j +
'a'?
```

**Solution**  
int
- Explanation:  
    int / int will result in an int
    Character constants actually have int type rather than char type,   
    when a character appears in a computation, C simply uses its integer value
